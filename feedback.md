# Project 2 Evaluation

## Technical Requirements
**2: Performing**
>The app contains 2 models, with at least 1 association. At least 1 model is full CRUD.
>Look into setting up a Category model instead of treating it like a string attribute.

## Creativity and Interface
**2: Performing**
>The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
>Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

## Deployment and Functionality
**2: Performing**
>Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**1: Progressing**
>App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application.
>Make sure to add a `planning` directory with your ERD in it and any other planning documents. Also, add much more detail to your README with the relevant information for the application: https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/documentation-markdown
